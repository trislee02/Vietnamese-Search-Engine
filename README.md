# Vietnamese-Search-Engine
Simple Search Engine for Vietnamese text

## Description
This is my project in the **Programming Technique** course. In this project, I had to make a simple search engine for Vietnamese texts and write a report about it. You can read the paper written in Vietnamese [here](Report.pdf).

## Architecture
Below is my general architecture. It was mainly based on this [Paper](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html). For more insight, please refer to the [Slide](VNSE Introduction.pdf) or [Report](Report.pdf).
